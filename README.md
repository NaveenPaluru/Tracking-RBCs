# Tracking-RBCs

Tracking by Detection framework for counting and localizing cells in a given video sequence.The count and properties of the cells in human body fluids provide vital information about health and are of   key  interest  in bio-medical research.This work aims at automating the process of detecting and tracking Red Blood Cells (RBCs) and sperm cells in Imaging cytometry. It  proposes  an extension of efficient and fast Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) referred to as “Discriminative Correlation Filter Tracking by Blob Detection” for multi-object tracking
